In the context of deep learning and LLMs like GPT, the term “parameters” refers
to the trainable weights of the model. These weights are essentially the internal vari-
ables of the model that are adjusted and optimized during the training process to
minimize a specific loss function. This optimization allows the model to learn from
the training data.
